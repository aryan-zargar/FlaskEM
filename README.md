# FlaskEM

**this app is based in flask & django and its the core is not written by myself**

this is only made for making easier to make flask apps 

Lets Start : 

install the flask & sqlalchemy : 

*pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy*

now you can search the functions and use them 

**Example : **

**@app.route("/")**

**def mainPage():**

**  return FlaskEM.AddPage("main.html",a=5,b=7)**

dont worry i will make a documentation for this but not now

For now you can search the functions I Add
